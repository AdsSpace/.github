## Projects

### 1. Video Based Classified Ads
    
    The platform works like just any other classifieds ads portal where people may publish their adverts
    exactly as they would in a classifieds portal but with a catch that they need to upload a short video
    instead of image if they want to sell/post ads and others can go through the ads just like shorts/reels.
